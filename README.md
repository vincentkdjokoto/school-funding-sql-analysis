# Public School Funding & Outcomes Analysis

## Project Overview
This SQL project analyzes the relationship between per-student spending and academic outcomes (particularly graduation rates) in public school districts. As an educationist-turned-data-analyst, I've designed this analysis to answer a critical policy question: **"Is there an observable relationship between per-student spending and graduation rates?"**

## Key Research Question
**Primary Question:** Is there an observable relationship between per-student spending and graduation rates in this dataset?
**Secondary Questions:**
- How does this relationship vary by socioeconomic factors (poverty levels)?
- Are there differences in spending efficiency between urban, suburban, and rural schools?
- Which schools achieve high graduation rates with relatively lower spending?
