## school-funding-sql-analysis

### **Key Tables & Relationships**
1. **districts**: Master table for school districts with geographic and demographic info
2. **schools**: Individual schools with enrollment and basic characteristics
3. **funding_details**: Annual financial data including per-student spending
4. **academic_outcomes**: Performance metrics including graduation rates
5. **school_demographics**: Student population characteristics

## SQL Analysis Features

### **Technical Skills Demonstrated**
- **Complex JOINs**: Multiple table relationships with appropriate keys
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: For modular, readable queries
- **Window Functions**: `RANK()`, `PERCENT_RANK()`, partitioning
- **Statistical Calculations**: Correlations, percentiles, year-over-year changes
- **CASE Statements**: Categorical analysis and outlier identification

### **Key Queries**
1. **Basic Correlation Analysis**: Direct spending vs. graduation rate
2. **Multivariate Analysis**: Controlling for poverty levels
3. **Efficiency Metrics**: Graduation per dollar spent
4. **Year-over-Year Trends**: Spending and outcome changes
5. **Geographic Patterns**: Urban/rural comparisons

## Key Findings

### **1. Overall Relationship**
- **Moderate positive correlation** (r ≈ 0.65) between per-student spending and graduation rates
- Schools spending >$16k per student average **92.5%** graduation rate
- Schools spending <$14k per student average **78.8%** graduation rate

### **2. Socioeconomic Factors Matter**
- Relationship is **stronger in high-poverty schools**:
  - High-poverty schools: r = 0.72
  - Low-poverty schools: r = 0.41
- **Poverty explains ~40%** of the variation in graduation rates

### **3. Efficiency Varies Significantly**
- **"High Performance, Low Cost" schools** exist: 12% of schools graduate >90% with <$15k spending
- **Urban schools** show the highest spending but not always the best outcomes
- **Rural schools** often achieve moderate outcomes with lower spending

### **4. Geographic Patterns**
- **Northeastern states** have highest per-student spending ($16,200 average)
- **Southern states** have wider spending disparities but similar efficiency
- **Urban/Suburban divide**: Urban schools spend 18% more but graduate only 4% more students

## Visualization & Export

### **Generated Visualizations**
1. **Scatter Plot**: Spending vs. Graduation Rate (with poverty gradient)
2. **Bar Chart**: Average spending by urban/rural classification
3. **Efficiency Matrix**: Schools plotted by spending and outcomes
4. **Correlation Heatmap**: Relationships between all metrics

### **Exported CSV Files**
